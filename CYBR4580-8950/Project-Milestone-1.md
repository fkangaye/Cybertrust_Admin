# Project CyberTrust

## CYBR4580/8950 Project Milestone 1:
Requirements analysis and planning (Project Proposal Stage)

### Executive Project Summary

It should contain the following:

A problem statement identifying relevant issues related to your bid. The problem statement might also discuss why these issues are a problematic for society, a particular industry/sector/company/agency, or a specific technology(ies).
Project goals and objectives in a numbered or bulleted list that you propose to undertake to address the identified problem. Clearly identify what you are doing at a high level with minimal technical detail.
The merit of accomplishing the project goals and objectives in terms of how it helps end users, society, or particular industries/sectors/companies/agencies.

### Proposed project timeline

The project will follow the following proposed timeline following the three project milestones. The first project milestone is the completion of this set up. Project milestone 2 is expected to complete 3/26/2019 with the development of a concept presentation. Project milestone 3 will conclude May with the projects final presentation.

The project timeline will be modified as needed and is located at this location:

### Risk list
![Risk Matrix](/CYBR4580-8950/SupDocs/RiskMatrix.png "Risk Matrix")
You should prepare a risk list table and add it to your README.md file in your GitHub project repo, beneath your Gantt chart. The table should use markdown syntax such as:

|Risk name (value)  | Impact     | Likelihood | Description |
|-------------------|------------|------------|-------------|
|Some risk (40) | 8 | 5 | Some description  |


### Project Methodology
Requirements are extremely important for conducting a successful project - of either the creative or assessment-oriented varieties. Collecting requirements about an application means understand what your end user (or what the end user of a product you are assessing) is going to do with the product. To understand requirements we often define user stories and use cases to encapsulate and represent behavior.

#### Literature Review
For milestone 1, you should prepare a literature review document that surveys the various research and development work in your project area. Your literature review should identify important keywords, relevant research papers, and the state of the art in your area.

#### Technical Plan
Once you have examined the relevant literature, you should prepare a technical plan that outlines and defines your methodology. Important consideration should be made to ensure that your methodology uses the literature to the best extent possible. Your technical plan should provide a detailed description of exactly what and how you will do what you plan to do.

### Resources Needed

Under your requirements section in the README.md file in your GitHub repo, clearly identify the technologies, products, and languages involved in your project. Include a table that identifies which team member will investigate each needed resource. Also include a column indicating whether or not material resources are needed from Dr. Hale.

Use the following table structure.

|Resource  | Dr. Hale needed? | Investigating Team member | Description |
|-------------------|---------|---------------------------|-------------|
|Some resource| No | Bob | Some description  |
|e.g. PLC unit | Yes | Gary | A programmable logic controller from Siemens for investigation.|

### First Sprint Plan

This part of the milestone is strictly captured by GitHub Projects (its a Kanban board technology like Trello). In your Kanban board, create a board following the structure discussed in class (see Lecture 4). Use this structure to identify the tasks that you will tackle in your first sprint. Put those tasks in the Sprint To-do category.
